	<h1>About me</h1>

	<p> <img src="Images/JulietteProfile.jpg" alt="Juliette" width="378" height="504" align="left">   Hello! My name is Juliette Wong and I am a second-year undergraduate student studying Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. </p>
	
	<p>   I am an aspiring business or data analyst, and I am especially interested in using statistics and/or technology to present data in the clearest way possible.  In my free time, I enjoy dancing, hand-making cards, and helping others out.</p>

	<p>   Feel free to browse my website to learn more about my work experience or involvement in extracurriculars and to check out my dance portfolio! </p>
