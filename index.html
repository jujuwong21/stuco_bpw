	<h1> Experience </h1>

	<h3> Independent Study</h3>
	<h4> CMU Human-Computer Interaction Department <br /> January 2019-Present </h4>
	<p> For the spring 2019 semester, I am a research assistant for Amy Shannon Cook and Anita Delahay, Ph.D. candidates in human-computer interaction and psychology, respectively. As a research assistant, I have helped with creating test materials, running participants, and analyzing qualitative and quantitative participant data using Excel and R to see whether or not watching others play educational games can help one learn material. </p>

	<h3> Summit for Developing Leaders Attendee</h3>
	<h4> Capital One <br /> January 2019 </h4>
	<p>I was one of thirty undergraduate sophomores nationwide selected to attend a week-long analytics program at Capital One's Plano, TX campus. I attended training sessions and workshops to learn about business analytics at Capital One. Additionally, I participated in a three-day team case competition, where my six-person team and I prototyped a budgeting app called BudgetWise and calculated its potential benefits to consumers and Capital One.</p>

	<h3> Career Peer Mentor</h3>
	<h4> CMU Career and Professional Development Center <br /> September 2018-Present </h4>
	<p>As a Career Peer Mentor (CPM), I work closely with career consultants and other CPMs to provide resources for first-year students. </p>

	<h3> Undergraduate Research Assistant</h3>
	<h4> CMU Mathematical Sciences Department <br /> May 2018-August 2018 </h4>
	<p>I was a research assistant under Dr. Jason Howell, the undergraduate department head for Carnegie Mellon's Mathematical Sciences Department. </p>
