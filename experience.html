		<div class=exp-words> I have been a research assistant for Amy Shannon Cook and Anita Delahay, Ph.D. candidates in HCI and psychology, respectively. As a research assistant, I have helped with creating test materials, running participants, and analyzing participant data using Excel to see whether or not watching others play educational games can help one learn material. The research tested under four different conditions to see which learning environment would lead to the most learning. Participants were either alone or with a partner, and they watched either an "expert" video or a tutor-tutee video. </div>

		<div class=exp-words>I was a research assistant under Dr. Jason Howell, the undergraduate department head for Carnegie Mellon's Mathematical Sciences Department. My research consisted of two different problems. For the first half of my research, my team and I were divided into subgroups to estimate the smallest value of a specific tri-diagonal matrix. Later on, my team and I analyzed MATLAB code to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Non-negative matrix factorization. </div>
