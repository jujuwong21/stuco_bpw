	<div class=exp-header> Independent Study </div>
	<div class=exp-sub>  CMU Human-Computer Interaction Department <br /> January 2019-Present </div>
	<div class=exp-words> For the spring 2019 semester, I am a research assistant for Amy Shannon Cook and Anita Delahay, Ph.D. candidates in human-computer interaction and psychology, respectively. As a research assistant, I have helped with creating test materials, running participants, and analyzing qualitative and quantitative participant data using Excel and R to see whether or not watching others play educational games can help one learn material. The research tested under four different conditions to see which learning environment would lead to the most learning. Participants were either alone or in a partner setting, and they watched either an "expert," lecture-style video or a tutor-tutee video. </div>

	<div class=exp-sub> Capital One <br /> January 2019 </div>
	<div class=exp-words>I was one of thirty undergraduate sophomores nationwide selected to attend a week-long analytics program at Capital One's Plano, TX campus. I attended training sessions and workshops to learn about business analytics at Capital One, and I had the opportunity to network with Capital One associates and other sophomores. Additionally, I participated in a three-day team case competition, where my six-person team and I prototyped a budgeting app called BudgetWise and calculated its potential benefits to consumers and Capital One.</div>

	<div class=exp-header> Undergraduate Research Assistant</div>
	<div class=exp-sub> CMU Mathematical Sciences Department <br /> May 2018-August 2018 </div>
	<div class=exp-words>I was a research assistant under Dr. Jason Howell, the undergraduate department head for Carnegie Mellon's Mathematical Sciences Department. My research consisted of two different problems. For the first half of my research, my team and I were divided into subgroups to estimate the smallest value of a specific tri-diagonal matrix. Later on, my team and I analyzed MATLAB code to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Non-negative matrix factorization. </div>
