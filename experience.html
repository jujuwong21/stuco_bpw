	<div class=exp-header> Independent Study </div>
	<div class=exp-sub>  CMU Human-Computer Interaction Department <br /> January 2019-Present </div>
	<div class=exp-words> For the spring 2019 semester, I am a research assistant for Amy Shannon Cook and Anita Delahay, Ph.D. candidates in human-computer interaction and psychology, respectively. As a research assistant, I have helped with creating test materials, running participants, and analyzing qualitative and quantitative participant data using Excel and R to see whether or not watching others play educational games can help one learn material. The research tested under four different conditions to see which learning environment would lead to the most learning. Participants were either alone or in a partner setting, and they watched either an "expert," lecture-style video or a tutor-tutee video. </div>
